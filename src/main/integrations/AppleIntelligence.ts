 * @abstract Apple Intelligence integration interface
 * 
 * This file defines an interface for integrating Apple Intelligence.
 * 
 * Apple intelligence is a fairly powerful on-device model which can be used
 * for varous NLP and image tasks such as:
 * * Summarizing and text generation
 * * Annotation
 * * Keypoints generation
 * * Keyword extraction
 * * Image captioning
 * * OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
 * 
 * This file defines the features we want to support.
 * Note that this will require macOS Catalina or later, and an Apple Silicon chip.
 * The Apple Intelligence integration will rely on a sidecar macOS application
 * written in Swift which will expose these functionalities via UNIX sockets.
 * 
 * It's also possible we might use Apple Intelligence via an RPC interface so
 * that we can run it on a different Mac device and save some battery :)
